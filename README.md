Calculate Your Raise
This simple Python code allows users to calculate salary increase based on current salary value. Here's how it works:

First, the program asks the user to enter their current salary.
It then checks whether the reported salary is greater than R$1250.00. If so, apply an increase rate of 10%. Otherwise, a 15% increase rate applies.
The salary increase is calculated by multiplying the current salary by the corresponding increase rate and adding that amount to the current salary.
The program then displays the value of the salary increase and the new salary on the screen, both rounded to two decimal places.
This code is useful for quickly calculating a salary increase based on different increase criteria, allowing for quick assessment of salary changes.
